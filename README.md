sigma.js - v1.0.3 - animateEdge plugin
=================

Sigma is a JavaScript library dedicated to graph drawing, mainly developed by [@jacomyal](https://github.com/jacomyal) and [@Yomguithereal](https://github.com/Yomguithereal).

animateEdge plugin is developed by Hamid Maadani [@21stcaveman](https://github.com/21stcaveman) for sigma.js . It allows users to animate an edge, draw just a percentage of the edge or draw a part of the edge thicker than the rest.

Please see ./examples/animateedge.html and ./examples/animate-route.html for usage.

For instructions on how to install and build Sigma.js, please see the master branch.
