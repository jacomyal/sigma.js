# Sigma.js full-featured demo

This project aims to provide a full-features "real life" application using sigma.js. It is built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), and uses [react-sigma](https://sim51.github.io/react-sigma/), to interface sigma.js with React.

## Dataset

The dataset has been kindly crafted by the [Sciences-Po m√©dialab](https://medialab.sciencespo.fr/) and [OuestWare](https://www.ouestware.com/en/) teams using [Seealsology](https://densitydesign.github.io/strumentalia-seealsology/). It represents a network of Wikipedia pages, connected by ["See also"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/See_also) links. It then was tagged by hand.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
